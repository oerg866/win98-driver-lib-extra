The files in this folder are driver files to be saved to DRIVER.EX on the CD.

They will *NOT* be copied to the hard drive or integrated in the windows
installation.

This may be because the drivers are not considered stable, or they are simply
very big or contain lots of hardware IDs.

Some of them may be ambiguous (such as responding to hardware IDs that do not
just correspond to one "chip" such as some realtek audio drivers).
